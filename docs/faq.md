# Frequently Asked Questions

## How is VidarDB different from other database systems?

There are several fundamental differences. First, unlike most database systems relying on the data structure designed in the 1970s, VidarDB employs a new data structure designed for modern memory architecture, efficiently supporting RAM, NVM, SSD, Disk as well as smooth data flow among these storage tiers. Additionally, it is a versatile data structure, which will adapt to and optimize for different workloads, such as operational, data analysis, streaming and even mixed of them. Then, we have brought the machine learning ability into VidarDB, where users can run familiar machine learning algorithms inside VidarDB via SQL, without moving your data to other tools.


## What is the relationship between VidarDB and PostgreSQL?

VidarDB utilizes the frontend of PostgreSQL, including its parser and optimizer, but replaces storage engine of PostgreSQL with a novel database engine based on a revolutionary data structure. Currently, we keep both storage engines coexisted. Thus, you can join two tables created from different engines. Once VidarDBâ€™s storage engine is mature, we will remove the engine of PostgreSQL. Meanwhile, VidarDB embraces the PostgreSQL ecosystem, meaning all the client drivers, tools and other components of PostgreSQL can be utilized in VidarDB directly without changing the code.


## Is VidarDB stable enough to use?

The idea and design of VidarDB are groundbreaking, but we do not develop VidarDB from scratch. Instead, the storage engine of VidarDB is built on a mature key-value store, RocksDB, where VidarDB seamlessly infuses the design and idea into the core data structure of RocksDB, and keeps the quality of code. Additionally, VidarDB effectively utilizes the frontend of PostgreSQL, a popular database system, resulting in a familiar interface to users.


## What are the system requirements for VidarDB?

VidarDB is written in C++, and natively runs on Linux systems. Other operating systems are being tested. We also provide [a docker image](https://www.vidardb.com/docs/run_vidarDB_with_docker/) for users to quickly deploy VidarDB on any platform.


## What client driver can I use to work with VidarDB?

VidarDB reuses the frontend of PostgreSQL, so the client drivers for PostgreSQL can also work with VidarDB without code change. Languages such as Java, C++, Python and C#/.Net are all supported.


## Does VidarDB support SQL?

Yes, VidarDB supports the SQL syntax in PostgreSQL. Users can even call AI algorithms with SQL.


## How is VidarDB licensed?

VidarDB is licensed under the modified BSD 3-Clause Clear License. Anyone, no matter person or enterprise, can use it for free. But selling it directly as a service in the cloud is prohibited.
